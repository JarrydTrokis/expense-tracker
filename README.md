# My Expense Tracker

A small Node/React application that I built, to experiment building Node APIs. This application developed to use AWS Lambda functions and AWS App Gateway in order to communicate with the MongoDB cloud instance.

The front end application is served up by the Node server. 

This project is still very much a work in progress, but has been extremely useful in allowing me to experiment with the AWS ecosystem.
